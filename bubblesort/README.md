## What is Bubble Sort?

A prerequisite to using search algorithms which are more efficient that linear search is to have sorted data.

One of the most basic sorting algorithms is **bubble sort**. Bubble sort works by comparing two adjacent numbers in
the list, and **swapping** them if they are **out of order**. 

![Bubble_Sort](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs50nestm/cs50labs/2019/bubblesort/bubble_sort.gif)

We see that, after our first pass through the array, the numbers are not completed sorted, but the largest number, 6, is at the end. Since we start swapping from left to right, the largest number will always end up at the end.

The pseudocode for **bubble sort** would look like this:

```
repeat until no swaps
    for i from 0 to n-2
        if i'th and i+1'th elements out of order
            swap them
```


## Computational Complexity

The worst case scenario for **bubble sort** is a reverse ordered list (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1). We would need 5, or `n - 1` passes and each pass would check 5, or `n - 1` pairs of numbers. 

When comparing running time, we generally just want the term with the biggest order of magnitude, so in this case, we would say that **bubble sort** has a complexity of **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**.

## Your Turn

Execute

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cs50nestm/cs50labs/2022/bubblesort/bubble.c
```

to download this problem's distro code.

Complete the `bubble_sort()` function to sort the supplied array. 

Notice that the bubble sort function has a return type of `void`. This means the function doesn't return anything. What it does do is sort the array.

The `print_array()` function is given to you to print out the array after you've sorted it, to make sure your algorithm works properly.

  <li>You might want to start this by simply using an outer <code>for</code> loop that iterates <code>n - 1</code> times, which corresponds to <code>n - 1</code> passes through the array.</li>
  <li>Then use an inner <code>for</code> loop that also iterates <code>n - 1</code> times. If you use the index variable <code>i</code> here, make sure to use another variable in the <code>for</code> loop in step 1.</li>
  <li>We now look at pairs of numbers. If <code>arr[i] > arr[i + 1]</code> then swap the two elements. You may need to use a temporary variable to do the swap.</li>

</ol>

Once you have your function sorting properly, see if you can make it more efficient! How to do this? There are two areas you might be able to improve.

1. See if you can have the function stop as soon as there are no more swaps. 

2. In a list with n elements, we would compare (n - 1) pairs in our first pass. And after our first pass, the largest element will have been swapped all the way to the right. So in our second pass, weâ€™ll only need (n - 2) comparisons.

  You may want to include a counter for the amount of swaps made. You can reset the counter to 0 just before you execute the inner <code>for</code> loop. After the inner loop is finished, check to see if <code>counter == 0</code>. If this is true there are no more swaps to be made and you can execute the <code>break</code> statement, which will terminate the outer loop.

## How to Test Your Code

You can check your code using check50, a program that CS50 will use to test your code when you submit, by typing in the following at the $ prompt. But be sure to test it yourself as well!

```
check50 cs50nestm/checks/2022/bubble
```

To evaluate that the style of your code, type in the following at the $ prompt.

```
style50 bubble.c
```

## How to Submit

In your terminal, execute the below to submit your work.

```
submit50 cs50nestm/checks/2022/bubble
```
